**Only edit the words that are in ALL UPPER CASE. Leave all the other things as they are. Considerations below.**

- If the "Featured playlists" section is shorter than 124 characters, add a `\` symbol and a `<br/>` tag on the line below. Otherwise, don't do it. This is an important field as people can find more easily the related videos of the channel.
- Pay attention to all the other characters: dots, commas, asterisks, etc.
- Append the youtuber at the end of the chosen section.
- Before making the pull request, make sure the layout looks good.
